For example if you maintain some packages,\r\nit's a crude way to check that your ebuilds still work (since gentoo is a rolling release, breakages could happen).\r\n\r\nIn other cases, you may want to install identical Gentoos on several computers.\r\n\r\nGenautoo is a solution for these situations.\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nGenautoo is two things:\r\n\r\n- A script generating a custom install iso for gentoo: genautoo.sh\r\n\r\n- An installer: installer/install.sh (and it's lib)\r\n\r\n## How do I use it?\r\n\r\nJust follow the steps:\r\n\r\n- create your config file \r\n    \r\n- run (as root, sorry):\r\n\r\n    ./genautoo.sh -a amd64 -c <path to your config file> -o my_custom_install.iso\r\n\r\n- burn the iso/dd it on a usb stick\r\n\r\n- boot the shit\r\n\r\n- take a (long) coffee (several in fact)\r\n\r\n- restart your computer (don't forget to remove the install media) and VOILA!\r\n\r\n## Okay, but how do I create the config file?\r\n\r\nJust use vim :) \r\n\r\nHumm, that's not helping? Okay. Creating the config file is simple, here is a simple example:\r\n\r\n    [global]\r\n    #some global parameters\r\n\r\n    #mirror=\"http://mirror.ovh.net/gentoo-distfiles/\"\r\n    #proxy=\"http://myproxy.example.net:8080\"\r\n    parallele_emerge=\"-j4\"\r\n    root_password=\"changeme\"\r\n\r\n    [network_install]\r\n    #network configuration during the installation\r\n    eth0 dhcp\r\n    #eth1 static 192.168.42.100/24\r\n    #route default gw 192.168.42.254\r\n    #dns 8.8.8.8\r\n\r\n    [network]\r\n    #network configuration of the installed system\r\n\r\n    [partitionning]\r\n    #partitions description\r\n\r\n    #DISK     SIZE     FS          MOUNT_POINT\r\n    /dev/sda   120M     ext4        /boot\r\n    /dev/sda   1G       reiserfs    /\r\n    /dev/sda   5G       ext4        /home\r\n    /dev/sda   5G       ext4        /usr\r\n    /dev/sda   1G       swap\r\n    /dev/sda   ALL      ext4        /var\r\n\r\n    [make.conf]\r\n    #lines ADDED to the make.conf\r\n\r\n    MAKEOPTS=\"-j8\"\r\n    ACCEPT_LICENSE=\"*\"\r\n    LINGUAS=\"en fr\"\r\n\r\n    [packages]\r\n    #list of the packages to install\r\n\r\n    net-misc/dhcpcd\r\n    app-editors/vim\r\n    sys-process/htop\r\n    sys-kernel/gentoo-sources\r\n\r\n    [pre_setup]\r\n    #script executed before anything has started\r\n\r\n    echo \"hello\"\r\n\r\n    [pre_install_nochroot]\r\n    #shell script executed just before the chrooting\r\n\r\n    echo \"I\"\r\n\r\n    [pre_install_chroot]\r\n    #shell script executed just after the chrooting\r\n\r\n    echo \"am\"\r\n\r\n    [post_install_chroot]\r\n    #shell script executed after the installation inside the chroot\r\n\r\n    echo \"genautoo\"\r\n\r\n    [post_install_nochroot]\r\n    #shell script executed after the installation outside the chroot\r\n\r\n    echo \"installer\"\r\n\r\nThe order of the section doesn't matter, and you can split a section, for example:\r\n\r\n    [global]\r\n    #some global parameters\r\n\r\n    [partitionning]\r\n    #partitions description\r\n\r\n    #DISK     SIZE     FS          MOUNT_POINT\r\n    /dev/sda   120M     ext4        /boot\r\n    /dev/sda   1G       reiserfs    /\r\n\r\n    [global]\r\n    #rest of the global parameters\r\n\r\nAny way, there are some examples in the examples directory.\r\n\r\n## How does the installer work?\r\n\r\nIt's simply a bunch of bourne shell scripts that use the config file to do what they have to do.\r\n\r\nMore explainations coming soon...\r\n\r\n## How does genautoo.sh work?\r\n\r\nJust take a look at the help:\r\n\r\n    ./genautoo.sh -h\r\n\r\nWithout optionnal arguments, it takes the installer, the config file, it downloads the lattest debian (hehehe) businesscard iso of the specified arch, and it builds a custom iso\r\n\r\nMore explainations coming soon...\r\n\r\n","tagline":"Genautoo: an automated installer for gentoo","note":"Don't delete this file!
