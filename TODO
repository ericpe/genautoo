Todo list, first one are more likely to be implemented, last ones, you could help :)

- more comments inside the code
- create some more evolved examples
- setting a better timeout on the iso
- implementing all the option listed in genautoo.sh (install of other .debs)
- handling multiple install scripts (isolinux menu) on one cd
- modification of the way we install .debs in the install cd (now, it's arch specific, you need to generate your cd on a system that as the same arch that your target)
- adding a true error handling inside the installer with error codes
- handling more arches
- handling lvm
- forking this stuff to see if it can be adapted and used for debian (... preseed, if you've tried it, you now what I mean)
