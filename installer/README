This is the genautoo installer.

In this directory you find:
- install.sh: the master script of the install
- conf: the general conf of the installer (default urls, default path etc...) 
- lib: the libs of the installer (in fact real things are done here)
- stages: submaster scripts for the 3 different stages of the install

See internal Readmes for more explanations
